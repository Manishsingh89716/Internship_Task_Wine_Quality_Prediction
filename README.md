# Internship_Task_Wine_Quality_Prediction

Task 2:- Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression

In this project I've built a Linear regression model which helps to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine good.
There is lot of regression model but I choose Linear regression model to predict quality of wine easily.

Tools:- Python, Machine learning and Jupyter.
